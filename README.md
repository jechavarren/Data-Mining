# Data Mining Coursework Repository - IIT

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of my Data Mining assignments completed at IIT. All the work is done in R and the repository is split into eight folders, each corresponding to a different assignment.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
In each folder, you'll find:
- A `CSV` file: The dataset used in the assignment
- An `R Notebook Markdown` file: Details on the computational steps 
- A `HTML` render: For an easy-to-view format of the notebook
- A `PDF` file: Answers to theoretical questions

## üìö Contents
The topics covered in each homework are as follows:

1. **HW1 - Exploratory Analysis:** Initial data investigation
2. **HW2 - Linear Regression:** Predictive model creation
3. **HW3 - Decision Trees:** Decision-making algorithm exploration
4. **HW4 - Data Preparation and Prediction Metrics:** Data cleaning and metric analysis
5. **HW5 - Association Rules and Market Basket Analysis:** Relationship exploration in data
6. **HW6 - Neural Networks, Programming a Perceptron:** Introduction to neural networks
7. **HW7 - Neural Networks, Multi-Layer Perceptron:** Advanced neural network exploration
8. **HW8 - Clustering:** Data grouping based on similarities

## üñ•Ô∏è Language
This repository is entirely in `R`, a popular language for statistical analysis and data visualization.

Enjoy exploring!
